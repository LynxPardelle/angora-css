# manage_classes.ts

## Overview

Simple class management module that provides essential functions for tracking and updating CSS classes within the Angora CSS library. This module serves as a lightweight interface for class state management and controlled CSS regeneration.

## Purpose

- Track and retrieve already created CSS classes
- Enable selective CSS class updates
- Provide controlled access to class regeneration
- Maintain consistency in class management operations

## Core Functions

### getAlreadyCreatedClasses(): string[]

**Returns:** Array of already created class names

**Purpose:** Retrieves the complete list of CSS classes that have been generated by the system.

**Features:**
- Logs current class list for debugging
- Provides read-only access to created classes
- Enables inspection of system state
- Useful for debugging and development

**Use Cases:**
- Debugging class generation issues
- Inspecting system state
- Tracking class creation patterns
- Development and testing

### updateClasses(classesToUpdate: string[]): void

**Parameters:**
- `classesToUpdate`: Array of class names to regenerate

**Purpose:** Triggers CSS regeneration for specified classes.

**Process:**
1. Accepts array of class names to update
2. Delegates to `cssCreate.cssCreate()` for actual regeneration
3. Maintains consistency by updating only specified classes

**Benefits:**
- Selective CSS regeneration for performance
- Controlled update mechanism
- Simplified interface for class updates
- Integration with core CSS generation

## Dependencies

- `ValuesSingleton` from `../singletons/valuesSingleton`
- `console_log` from `./console_log`
- `cssCreate` from `./cssCreate`

## State Management

### Class Tracking
- Accesses `values.alreadyCreatedClasses` from singleton
- Provides read-only interface to class state
- Maintains consistency with global class tracking

### Update Control
- Provides controlled interface for CSS updates
- Delegates to core CSS generation functions
- Ensures proper update workflow

## Integration Points

### With CSS Generation
- Direct integration with `cssCreate` module
- Enables selective class regeneration
- Maintains update consistency

### With Debug System
- Logs class state for debugging
- Provides visibility into class management
- Supports development and troubleshooting

### With Singleton Management
- Accesses global class state through singleton
- Maintains consistency across library
- Provides centralized class tracking

## Performance Considerations

### Selective Updates
- Enables targeted CSS regeneration
- Avoids unnecessary full rebuilds
- Optimizes performance for specific updates

### Lightweight Operations
- Minimal processing overhead
- Simple interface for common operations
- Efficient state access patterns

## Usage Patterns

### Class State Inspection
```javascript
// Get all created classes
const createdClasses = manage_classes.getAlreadyCreatedClasses();
console.log('Created classes:', createdClasses);
```

### Selective Class Updates
```javascript
// Update specific classes
manage_classes.updateClasses(['m-10', 'p-5', 'bg-red']);
```

### Debug and Development
```javascript
// Check class creation state
const classes = manage_classes.getAlreadyCreatedClasses();
// Useful for debugging class generation issues
```

## Error Handling
